The pricing model behind flights is based upon many hidden factors and fluctuates on a 
regular basis which leads to scenarios where you will pay more for a flight when compared to one of a similar distance. This fluctuating flight price may lead to larger personal expenditures and this application is meant to help guide a person looking to purchase a flight ticket and reveal to them if they are paying more than the average flight of a similar distance.
